  - text: |-
      The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
      Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

      SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 
       FROM table_name;
  utter_chitchat/ask_SELECT_all:
  - text: |-
      To select all fields in a table you have to use the astric (*) with SELECT, 'SELECT * FROM table_name'.
       This returns all values in a table.
